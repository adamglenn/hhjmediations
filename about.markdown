After 35 years as a civil litigator, with experience throughout WV in state and federal courts, I have left my firm and started HHJ Mediations, LLC. My services include mediation, arbitration, and other forms of alternative dispute resolution. 

With experience representing plaintiffs and defendants, I have participated in dozens of mediations, including pre-suit mediation, mediations in litigation in state and federal courts, before the Mass Litigation Panel and the West Virginia Business Court Division. I currently serve on the West Virginia State Barâ€™s Alternative Dispute Resolution Committee and have completed (and taught) the basic and advanced mediation training provided by the West Virginia State Bar.

I have conducted numerous mediations and arbitrations both virtual (Zoom) and in person.
